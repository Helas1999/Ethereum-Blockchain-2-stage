Ethereum Blockchain Development Stages/2
6. Metropolis: Byzantium (October 2017)
Security and Privacy Enhancements: The Byzantium upgrade introduced various cryptographic techniques to enhance security and privacy, such as zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge).
Network Upgrades: It also introduced several optimizations to improve scalability and performance, making Ethereum more suitable for real-world applications.
7. Metropolis: Constantinople (February 2019)
Improving Efficiency: The Constantinople upgrade focused on improving the network’s efficiency and reducing the cost of smart contract execution. It included changes to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and a reduction in the block reward for miners.
Transition to Proof of Stake (PoS): Constantinople also laid the groundwork for Ethereum’s future transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) through the Casper protocol.
8. Istanbul (December 2019)
Scaling and Interoperability: The Istanbul upgrade included improvements to scalability, such as EIP-152 (which enhanced interoperability with Zcash) and EIP-1108 (reducing gas costs for certain operations).
Security Enhancements: Istanbul also introduced additional security features to protect against potential attacks and improve network resilience.
9. The Merge (September 2022)
Proof of Stake (PoS): The Merge marked Ethereum’s shift from the energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof of Stake (PoS). This transition significantly reduced Ethereum's energy consumption and laid the foundation for future scalability solutions like sharding.
Ethereum 2.0: The Merge was a critical milestone in the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve scalability, security, and sustainability.
10. Future Upgrades and Sharding (Post-2023)
Sharding: Ethereum is preparing for the sharding upgrade, which will split the Ethereum network into smaller, more manageable pieces (shards) to greatly enhance scalability and throughput.
Layer-2 Solutions: Ethereum is also focusing on Layer-2 solutions like Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups to further enhance transaction throughput and lower gas costs.
These stages represent Ethereum’s evolution, and each upgrade aims to address specific challenges such as scalability, security, and decentralization, which will continue to shape the future of the blockchain.
